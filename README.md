# Powerline-Project
A small project I had done as a student of the masters program in Sustainable Resource Management at TU Munich. I uploaded the work break down structure along with the results in this repo. The whole project is done in the ArcGIS 10x environment. The goal of the project was to find out how much timber is needed to be extract to facilitate the flow of powerlines through a forest.
